# Image_Classification

## This program uses images from the Plant Pathology 2021 Kaggle Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/plant-pathology-2021-fgvc8/overview) to classify if a leaf is diseased. For my portion of the project, I used and optimized a Random Forest Classifier and an XGBoost model. Both models obtained ~60%-70% accuracy on the testing dataset.
